# Validation Story -7.i: Validate Implementation - Documentation Updates

**Type**: validation_implementation
**Status**: unassigned
**Parent**: -7
**Validates**: 7.i
**Phase**: validation_implementation
**Checks**: I (Implementation Validation)

---

## Purpose

Validate that the implementation phase of Story 7 (Documentation Updates) correctly implemented all acceptance criteria defined in the story.

## Validation Target

**Story**: 7.i - Implementation: Documentation Updates
**Expected Artifact**: plans/7-plan.yaml

## Check I: Implementation Validation

### Objective

Verify that all acceptance criteria from Story 7 were implemented in code during story 7.i.

### Method

1. Load the story file: `stories/7-documentation-updates.md`
2. Extract acceptance criteria from the story
3. For each acceptance criterion:
   - Identify the code changes that implement it
   - Verify the implementation matches the requirement
   - Check for completeness and correctness

### Success Criteria

- All acceptance criteria have corresponding code implementations
- Code implementations are correct and complete
- No missing or partial implementations

### Failure Actions

If any acceptance criterion is not fully implemented:
- Create remediation story for missing/incomplete work
- Document the gap in validation results
- Block validation_testing phase until remediation complete

## Execution Notes

This validation story will be executed by the /sprint:NEXT command using the validation helper:
- Helper: `~/.claude/resources/commands/sprint/execute-validation-story.md`
- Auto-routing to validation_implementation phase execution
