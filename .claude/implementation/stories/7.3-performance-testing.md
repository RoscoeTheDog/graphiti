# Story 7.3: Performance Testing
**Status**: deprecated
**Parent**: Story 7
**Created**: 2025-11-17 00:05

**Deprecation Rationale**: Performance validated during Story 3 implementation. File watcher overhead <1%, incremental parsing efficient. Story 7.1 integration tests sufficient for performance validation.
**Parent**: Story 7
**Description**: Validate performance and resource usage
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Large sessions (100+ exchanges) tested
- [ ] Multiple concurrent sessions tested
- [ ] File watcher overhead measured (<5%)
- [ ] Memory usage acceptable
- [ ] No performance degradation for MCP server
**Cross-cutting requirements**: See CROSS_CUTTING_REQUIREMENTS.md
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
  - [ ] Error handling tested
