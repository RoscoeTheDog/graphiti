## Status

**Empty** - This is a STD project (no BMAD).

Per EPHEMERAL-FS policy, research findings are stored in graphiti memory (~800 words) with optional reference files in `~/.claude/research/` on the agent machine, not in the project repository.

---

## Storage Policy

- **BMAD Projects:** Research stored in `docs/research/` + graphiti metadata (~500w)
- **STD Projects (this):** Research stored in graphiti memory (~800w) + `~/.claude/research/` (agent machine)

## Notes

If research files are needed in the future, they can be added here and tracked in this INDEX.md.
