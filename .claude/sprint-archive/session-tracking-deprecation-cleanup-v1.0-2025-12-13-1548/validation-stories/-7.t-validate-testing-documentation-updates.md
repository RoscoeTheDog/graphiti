# Validation Story -7.t: Validate Testing - Documentation Updates

**Type**: validation_testing
**Status**: unassigned
**Parent**: -7
**Validates**: 7.t
**Phase**: validation_testing
**Checks**: D, E, F, G, H (Testing Validation)

---

## Purpose

Validate that the testing phase of Story 7 (Documentation Updates) completed all required test validation checks.

## Validation Target

**Story**: 7.t - Testing: Documentation Updates
**Expected Artifact**: plans/7-plan.yaml

## Validation Checks

### Check D: Test Results

**Objective**: Verify testing phase was completed and results documented

**Method**:
1. Load story file: `stories/7.t-testing-documentation-updates.md`
2. Verify testing section contains results
3. Check that acceptance criteria were validated
4. Confirm pass/fail status is clear

**Success Criteria**:
- Testing results are documented
- All acceptance criteria were checked
- Clear pass/fail determination

### Check E: Test Coverage

**Objective**: Verify test coverage meets quality standards

**Method**:
1. Review test requirements from `plans/7-plan.yaml`
2. Check what tests were executed
3. Verify coverage of all acceptance criteria
4. Assess adequacy of test approach

**Success Criteria**:
- All acceptance criteria have corresponding tests
- Test approach is appropriate for documentation changes
- Coverage is complete

### Check F: Advisory Generation

**Objective**: Verify advisories were created if tests failed

**Method**:
1. Check if any tests failed in 7.t
2. If failures exist, verify advisory files were created
3. Validate advisory content and remediation guidance

**Success Criteria**:
- If tests passed: No advisories needed
- If tests failed: Advisories exist and are actionable

### Check G: Completion Criteria

**Objective**: Verify story meets completion thresholds

**Method**:
1. Calculate acceptance criteria pass rate
2. Check against 90% threshold (warning) and 100% threshold (ideal)
3. Verify status reflects results

**Success Criteria**:
- Pass rate >= 90% for completion
- Status correctly reflects results
- Appropriate actions taken (advisories, blocking)

### Check H: Validation Hierarchy

**Objective**: Ensure validation container structure is correct

**Method**:
1. Verify -7 container has all three phases (.d, .i, .t)
2. Check phase dependencies and ordering
3. Validate status propagation to parent

**Success Criteria**:
- All three validation phases exist
- Phases executed in correct order
- Parent status reflects aggregate results

## Execution Notes

This validation story will be executed by the /sprint:NEXT command using the validation helper:
- Helper: `~/.claude/resources/commands/sprint/execute-validation-story.md`
- Auto-routing to validation_testing phase execution

## Validation Results

### Check D: Test Results ✓ PASS

**Objective**: Verify testing phase was completed and results documented

**Findings**:
- Test results file exists: `.claude/sprint/test-results/7-results.json`
- Testing section contains comprehensive results
- All acceptance criteria (AC-7.1, AC-7.2, AC-7.3, AC-7.4) were validated
- Clear pass/fail determination: 100% pass rate (4/4 tests passed)

**Status**: PASS

---

### Check E: Test Coverage ✓ PASS

**Objective**: Verify test coverage meets quality standards

**Findings**:
- Test requirements from `plans/7-plan.yaml` were executed
- Manual verification tests performed for all acceptance criteria:
  - AC-7.1: Remove deprecated params from CONFIGURATION.md - PASSED
  - AC-7.2: Update session tracking section - PASSED
  - AC-7.3: Archive superseded specs - PASSED
  - AC-7.4: Update README - PASSED
- Test approach (manual review) is appropriate for documentation changes
- Coverage is complete (4/4 ACs tested)

**Status**: PASS

---

### Check F: Advisory Generation ✓ PASS

**Objective**: Verify advisories were created if tests failed

**Findings**:
- All tests passed (100% pass rate)
- No failures detected
- No advisories needed

**Status**: PASS (no advisories required)

---

### Check G: Completion Criteria ✓ PASS

**Objective**: Verify story meets completion thresholds

**Findings**:
- Acceptance criteria pass rate: 100% (4/4)
- Exceeds 90% warning threshold
- Meets 100% ideal threshold
- Status correctly reflects results (all tests passed)
- No blocking actions needed

**Status**: PASS

---

### Check H: Validation Hierarchy ✓ PASS

**Objective**: Ensure validation container structure is correct

**Findings**:
- Validation container -7 exists with all three phases
- Phase children: -7.d (completed), -7.i (completed), -7.t (in_progress)
- Phases executed in correct order: discovery → implementation → testing
- Parent container (-7) correctly references target story (7)
- Phase types are correct:
  - -7.d: validation_discovery
  - -7.i: validation_implementation
  - -7.t: validation_testing

**Status**: PASS

---

## Summary

**Overall Result**: ✓ ALL CHECKS PASSED

All testing validation checks passed successfully. Story 7 testing phase demonstrates:
- Complete test coverage (100% of ACs tested)
- Perfect pass rate (4/4 tests passed)
- Proper validation hierarchy
- No advisories needed
- All dependencies satisfied

**Validation Status**: Completed
**Blocking Issues**: None
**Remediations Created**: 0

**Recommendation**: Validation testing phase complete. Story 7 validation is fully successful across all three phases (discovery, implementation, testing).
