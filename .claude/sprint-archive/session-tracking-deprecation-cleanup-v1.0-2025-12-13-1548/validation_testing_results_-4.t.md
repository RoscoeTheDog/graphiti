**Overall Result**: COMPLETED (no blocking issues)

---

## Check Results

### ✅ Check D: Test Pass Rates

**Status**: PASS (non-blocking warning)

**Findings**:
- Total tests: 865
- Passed: 834 (96.4%)
- Failed: 31 (pre-existing Graphiti connectivity issues)
- Threshold: 90% for P1, 100% for P0
- **Result**: 96.4% > 90% threshold ✓

**P0 Acceptance Criteria Coverage**:
- AC-4.1 (P0): Remove `check_inactive_sessions_periodically` - ✅ PASSED
- AC-4.2 (P0): Remove `check_interval` usage - ✅ PASSED

**P1 Acceptance Criteria Coverage**:
- AC-4.3 (P1): Simplify `initialize_session_tracking` - ✅ PASSED (96.4% pass rate)
- AC-4.4 (P1): Remove logging statements - ✅ PASSED

**Advisory**: Low severity test warning exists (96.4% pass rate, 31 pre-existing failures)

**Blocking**: No (meets 90% threshold)

### ✅ Check E: Advisory Status Alignment

**Status**: PASS

**Findings**:
- Story status: `completed`
- Advisory severity: `low` (test_warning)
- Expected status: `completed` with warning
- **Result**: Status correctly aligned with advisory severity ✓

**Advisory Message**: "Test pass rate 96.4% - 31 tests require Graphiti MCP server connectivity (non-blocking, pre-existing)"

---

### ✅ Check F: Hierarchy Consistency

**Status**: PASS

**Findings**:
- Parent story: 4 (Clean Up MCP Server Session Initialization)
- Story 4 children: 4.d, 4.i, 4.t ✓
- Story 4.t parent: 4 ✓
- All phase relationships consistent ✓

**Result**: Parent-child hierarchy is consistent and properly formed

---

### ✅ Check G: Advisory Alignment

**Status**: PASS

**Findings**:
- Story 4.t advisory: test_warning (96.4% pass rate)
- Story 4 advisory metadata: Contains same test_warning
- **Result**: Advisory properly propagated to parent story ✓

**Propagation**: Low severity test advisory correctly reflected in parent story metadata

---

### ✅ Check H: Dependency Graph Alignment

**Status**: PASS (informational)

**Findings**:
- Declared dependencies: Stories 1, 2, 3
- Story 1 status: `completed` ✓
- Story 2 status: `completed` ✓
- Story 3 status: `completed` ✓
- **Result**: All dependencies satisfied before execution ✓

**Dependency Chain**:
1. Story 1: Remove Deprecated Config Parameters → COMPLETED
2. Story 2: Remove Session Manager Time-Based Logic → COMPLETED
3. Story 3: Remove File Watcher Module → COMPLETED
4. Story 4: Clean Up MCP Server Session Initialization → COMPLETED

## Quality Metrics

| Check | Status | Blocking | Auto-Fixed |
|-------|--------|----------|------------|
| D - Test Pass Rates | ✅ PASS | No | N/A |
| E - Advisory Status | ✅ PASS | No | N/A |
| F - Hierarchy | ✅ PASS | No | N/A |
| G - Advisory Alignment | ✅ PASS | No | N/A |
| H - Dependencies | ✅ PASS | Never | N/A |

## Recommendations

### Optional Improvements
1. **Graphiti Test Failures**: 31 tests failing due to missing Graphiti MCP server connectivity
   - **Impact**: Low (pre-existing, unrelated to Story 4)
   - **Action**: Can be addressed separately if Graphiti integration is needed
   - **Priority**: P2 (non-blocking)

### Cleanup Tasks
None identified - story is clean and well-tested.

## Conclusion

Story 4.t successfully passed all testing validation checks. The story:
- ✅ Meets test pass rate thresholds (96.4% > 90%)
- ✅ Has proper advisory alignment
- ✅ Maintains correct hierarchy relationships
- ✅ Completed after all dependencies satisfied
- ✅ No blocking issues detected

**Final Status**: COMPLETED

**Validation Story Status**: Mark -4.t as `completed`
