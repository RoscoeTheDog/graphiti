## Critical Findings

### Main Issue: Story 13 is a Stub File

Story 13 is an auto-generated stub that was never completed. The file contains:
- Placeholder title: "[Story description needed]"
- Placeholder acceptance criteria: "[Criterion 1]", "[Criterion 2]"
- Placeholder implementation notes: "[Implementation details needed]"
- Note: "This is a stub file auto-generated by queue integrity monitor"

### Status Contradiction

- **Queue Graph Status**: "completed" (now changed to "stub")
- **Actual State**: Incomplete stub with no content

---

## Validation Checks Detail

### Passed (2/11)
✅ **Check F: Hierarchy Consistency** - No parent/child issues (top-level story)
✅ **Check H: Dependency Graph** - No dependencies defined (consistent)

### Failed (7/11)
❌ **Check A: Metadata** - Type "unknown", invalid status, no priority
❌ **Check B: Acceptance Criteria** - Only placeholders exist
❌ **Check C: Requirements Traceability** - No requirements to trace
❌ **Check D: Test Pass Rates** - No tests exist (0% vs required 100%)
❌ **Check E: Status Alignment** - Status "completed" contradicts stub state
❌ **Check I: Code Implementation** - No code exists
❌ **Check J: Quality Score** - 0/100 (all categories at 0%)

### N/A (2/11)
ℹ️ **Check G: Advisory Alignment** - No substories
ℹ️ Auto-repair checks - Cannot apply to stub files

## Why Auto-Repair Failed

This story **cannot be auto-repaired** because:
1. No baseline requirements exist (only placeholders)
2. Cannot create remediation stories without acceptance criteria
3. Cannot fix metadata when file contradicts queue status
4. No implementation to validate or test

2. ✅ Updated Validation Story -13 status: `unassigned` → `blocked`
3. ✅ Updated Story 13 status: `completed` → `stub`
4. ❌ Cannot create remediation stories (no baseline requirements)
