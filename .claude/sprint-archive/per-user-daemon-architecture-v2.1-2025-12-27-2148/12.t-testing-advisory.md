## Acceptance Criteria Validation

All Story 12 acceptance criteria have been verified:

### (t) Testing Phase
- ✅ (P0) Verify config is copied to correct new location
  - Test: test_migrate_config_copies_to_correct_location - PASSED
- ✅ Verify original config is preserved as backup
  - Test: test_migrate_config_preserves_original_as_backup - PASSED
- ✅ Verify config content is unchanged after migration
  - Test: test_migrate_config_preserves_content - PASSED

### Additional Tests
- ✅ Skip migration when no v2.0 config exists
- ✅ Create timestamped backups
- ✅ Deep merge preserves primary keys
- ✅ Handle conflicts with force overwrite
- ✅ Deep merge handles nested structures
- ✅ Merge handles non-dict values

## Implementation Quality

- **Code Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite covering all migration scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: Tested no-config, conflicts, force overwrite, merge logic
- **Error Handling**: Validated backup creation and content preservation
- **Cross-Platform**: Tests use platform-agnostic pathlib
